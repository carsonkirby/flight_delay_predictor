# Flight Delay Predictor

## Project Details
### The flight delay predictor is a tool I built in Python for my Computational Thinking class. It takes flight data from July 2023 for all domestic flights that happened during the month. This data is stored in the July23_Flight_Delays.csv file. Ultimately, the predictor will return a text file that compares factors like duration of delay and number of flights in and out of two airports of the user's choosing. Airport codes and their corresponding city can be found at https://www.leonardsguide.com/us-airport-codes.shtml. 

## What I Learned:
### Through this project, I learned how to built dictinaries in Python and implement them in functions that return useful information. I was challenged to use several functions that took the dictinaries as arguments and wrote the appopriate stats onto a new file. 

## How to Run Application:
